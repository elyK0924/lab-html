        <br><i>The applet that appears upon launching the Python application.</i>
        <p>
            This application was created to solve a specific problem: I had pictures that I wanted to store digitally, and all within one file.
            Thus, this Photos-to-PDF application was born! This implementation takes advantage of a couple of Python's libraries:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Pillow:</strong> used for converting the image file (.png, .jpg, etc.) into a PDF file.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Tkinter:</strong> used to create the UI and applet to perform conversions.
                </li>
            </ul>
