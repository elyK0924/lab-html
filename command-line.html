                This project was done as part of Professor Rafael Ubal Tena's <strong>Operating Systems</strong> course at Boston College.
                It interacts directly with the user's UNIX operating system in order to execute commands as they would be written in a UNIX command shell.
                This shell implementation supports: 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>input and output redirection</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>background execution</strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>command piping</strong> and 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>forking</strong>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                among other features.
